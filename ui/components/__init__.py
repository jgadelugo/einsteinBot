MathBot UI Components Package

This package contains the individual UI components for the MathBot interface:
- GraphViewer: Interactive mathematical knowledge graph visualization
- TheoremBrowser: Searchable theorem exploration interface  
- ProofViewer: Step-by-step proof trace visualization
- SearchInterface: Advanced search and filtering capabilities

Each component is designed to be modular, reusable, and type-safe.
