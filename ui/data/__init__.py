"""
MathBot UI Data Access Layer

This package provides data models and loaders for the MathBot UI:
- models.py: Pydantic models for theorem, formula, and validation data
- loaders.py: Data loading utilities for reading from files and APIs

The data layer provides a clean abstraction between the UI components
and the underlying data sources, enabling easy testing and future
data source changes.
