MathBot UI Utilities Package

This package contains utility functions and helpers for the MathBot UI:
- formatting.py: LaTeX/mathematical expression formatting utilities
- graph_utils.py: Graph processing and layout utilities

These utilities are designed to be pure functions that can be easily
tested and reused across different UI components.
